I am a lecturer in Artificial Intelligence at Queen Mary University of London. Before becoming a lecturer, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Swiss AI lab working on reinforcement learning under the supervision of JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber.

I believe that intelligence should be defined as a measure of the ability of an agent to achieve goals in a wide range of environments, which makes reinforcement learning an excellent framework to study many challenges that intelligent agents are bound to face. 

My current research is focused on developing principled but scalable Bayesian reinforcement learning methods that address the most significant of these challenges: exploration, planning, and generalization.
