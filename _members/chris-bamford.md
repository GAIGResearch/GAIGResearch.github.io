Chris earned a MEng in Applied Cybernetics in 2012 and since then has been working as the Lead RnD Engineer at the start-up import.io.
Chris got bored of working in industry and wanted to do something really challenging.
In his spare time away from programming, he enjoys drinking, angry music and going to the gym.
