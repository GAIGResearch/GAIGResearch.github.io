Research topic: Modelling Bimanual Interaction Through Bimanual Interactive Games for Neurorehabilitation

Nuria got her bachelor in biomedical engineering in Spain before moving to London. After studying an MSc in Neurotechnology and working in robotic neurorehabilitation at Imperial College London, she has discovered the enormous potential of serious games in the field of robotics and human interaction. Her projects have included the development of small games in Unity as a tool to study human coordination. She is extremely excited she will learn new ways of contributing to the field thanks to the IGGI program. When she is not coding, or eating, or eating and coding, she enjoys travelling and playing or listening to music.

# PhD Defense

Nuria’s research was on exploring gamification and visuo-haptic interaction for studying fundamental principles of bimanual control in humans. Nuria’s research has potential impact on the development of upper-limb neuro-rehabilitation technology, for example home-based bi-manual rehabilitation games for post-stroke recovery. The results were published in leading journals (IEEE T Haptics, Neurophysiology, IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters) and conferences IEEE EMBC (best student paper finalist) and IEEE World Haptics. This was a collaborative work with the colleagues from Imperial College London. Nuria’s research was funded by the CDT IGGI.

The examiners were Professor David Franklin (Technical University of Munich, Germany) and Professor Rui Loureiro (University College London, UK).
Nuria’s supervision team included Professor Etienne Burdet (Imperial) and Dr Laurissa Tokarchuk (QMUL).

Nuria will move to Imperial College London (Department of Bioengineering) for her postdoctoral research.
