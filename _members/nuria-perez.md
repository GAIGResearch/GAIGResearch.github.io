Nuria got her bachelor in biomedical engineering in Spain before moving to London. After studying an MSc in Neurotechnology and working in robotic neurorehabilitation at Imperial College London, she has discovered the enormous potential of serious games in the field of robotics and human interaction. Her projects have included the development of small games in Unity as a tool to study human coordination. She is extremely excited she will learn new ways of contributing to the field thanks to the IGGI program. When she is not coding, or eating, or eating and coding, she enjoys travelling and playing or listening to music.
