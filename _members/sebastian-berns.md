Research topic: High-Fidelity Diversity in Data-Driven Generative Systems

My research interests focus on machine intelligence in the creative process and on creativity as a cognitive phenomenon. I study generative machine learning algorithms in a computational creativity setting. In this context I am particularly interested in combining representation learning with symbolic reasoning systems. 

Before transitioning into computation I worked independently as a graphic designer, specialising in web, typography and communication for art and culture.
