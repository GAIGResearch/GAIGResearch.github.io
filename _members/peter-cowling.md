[Professor of AI](http://www.petercowling.com/research/) | [IGGI Director](http://iggi.org.uk/) | [DC Labs Director](https://digitalcreativity.ac.uk/)

I’m passionate about AI and Games - ever since I was 8 years old :). I believe game devs and university researchers have a lot to gain by working together - tech, ideas and recruits for the game devs, and relevant directions for the university researchers. I’ve been successful in bringing the UK games industry and UK universities much closer together - leading projects worth tens of millions of pounds to support over 100 researchers working with dozens of UK games companies in the [IGGI](http://www.iggi.org.uk) (Intelligent Games and Game Intelligence) and [DC labs](http://www.digitalcreativity.ac.uk) (Digital Creativity Labs) programmes. The next generation of even more engaging and culturally important games might well come from such a collaboration.
