Alvaro is interested in the teleonomic and teleological principles of living beings and the prospect of babysitting artificial agents that can develop their own values, drives, goals and purpose in life just like those in nature. Before coming to Queen Mary, Alvaro spent some time in Sussex learning about evolutionary systems and in the University of Edinburgh studying neuroscience and machine learning.
