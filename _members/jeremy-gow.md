I’m a lecturer at EECS and a member of the Game AI research group since August 2018.  I have a background in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction research, and a PhD in AI from the University of Edinburgh.

My research is mainly on computational game design: how can computers understand play and help us design video games?  More broadly, I’m interested in computational creativity, procedural content generation, game AI, player analytics and player experience.
