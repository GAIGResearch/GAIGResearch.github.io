# Biography
<br/>
I am a versatile Software Engineer with 4 years of experience in web development across different areas of the tech stack. I studied Software and Computer Engineering at Universidad AutoÃÅnoma de Madrid (Spain) and I am currently completing a PhD in AI and games at Queen Mary University of London (UK); during which I have done two internships at Google.

I am technology agnostic and passionate about solving problems and learning. I am interested in video games, the creation of frameworks and approaches to assist in their development and testing as well as looking for new applications for AI.

Random facts are that I am a Ravenclaw, one of my favourite games is Portal, I like swords, and my chosen superpower would be teleportation.

## Beyond Playing to Win: Broadening the Study and Use of General Agents

A significant part of Game AI research actively explores and advances the play strength of general agents, which are able to play video games without having specific knowledge about them, leading to the existence of a wide range of general algorithms. My work proposes to take advantage of the progress in this area and broaden the research of GVGP beyond playing games with the objective of winning at them. I am focusing on three approaches: 1) diversifying their goals and heuristics; 2) taking advantage of the distinct behaviours given by them so they can be used to facilitate the automatization of testing techniques; and 3) analysing their strengths from a Player Experience perspective instead of their performance. 

The main interest of my research is looking into new applications for existing AI algorithms, so they are used for tasks that go beyond "just winning". One of these is the use of the agents to run games automatically so they can assist in their development and testing.
