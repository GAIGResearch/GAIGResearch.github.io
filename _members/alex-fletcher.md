Alex's background is as an freelance trumpet player, audio engineer and music technology tutor, with 10+ years professional experience. Realising he had a passion in game design and coding, Alex completed an MA in Independent Games and Playable Experience Design at Goldsmiths (London). His final project explored consumer EEG devices as an alternative game controller, machine learning models, adaptive audio and novel game design approaches that ended by showcasing with the British Council 'PlayUK Festival' in Macedonia. Within this journey it has inspired him to become a Research Student with the IGGI, and progress with pushing the boundaries of games and what they mean to people.
