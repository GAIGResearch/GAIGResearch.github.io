Sahar is a researcher, positive psychology practitioner and coach interested in the role of gaming during difficult life experiences and how it could support wellbeing. Her PhD explores the role of heathy escapism as a framework for investigating complex emotional experiences in the context of digital play. She hopes to bring an interdisciplinary approach to her research by combining positive psychology, coaching and computer science in understanding the nuanced player experience during challenging life experiences.
