Research topic: Opponent Modelling in Tabletop Games

James is interested in opponent modelling, theory of mind and strategic communication in multi-player games - what do I think that she thinks that you think, and should I tell you? In particular how this can be integrated efficiently into statistical forward planning algorithms. At various points James has picked up degrees in Chemistry, History, Mathematics, Business Administration and Machine Learning. After a career in Consultancy and IT Project Management of global financial systems he is now finally doing the research he always wanted to. Otherwise he can be found playing tabletop games and writing LARPs.
