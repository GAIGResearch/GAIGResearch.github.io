My research is in the area of motivation and well-being in games, specifically the role of game design features in satisfaction of the need for autonomy. Iâ€™m interested in the various ways self-determination theory can be applied in games and gamification, as well as the situations in which it may not apply. I hope to discover more about the extent to which satisfaction of each basic need (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) can be individually optimised in games, with the ultimate goal of informing game design that promotes harmonious engagement. I also have a strong interest in robust, reproducible, and properly-incentived science.
