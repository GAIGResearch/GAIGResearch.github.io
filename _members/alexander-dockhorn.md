I studied Computer Science at the Otto-von-Guericke University (OvGU) in Magdeburg (Germany) and University of Abertay in Dundee (Scotland). Back in Magdeburg I finished my Master in Computer Science and after which I joined the Computational Intelligence research group lead by Prof. Rudolf Kruse and Prof. Sanaz Mostaghim. After finishing my PhD thesis on the topics forward model learning and predictive state determinization I joined the Game AI Research Group as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant. My current research interests are intelligent data analysis and more generalised methods for forward model learning.
