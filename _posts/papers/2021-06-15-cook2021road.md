abstract: "Automated game design is a rapidly growing area of research, yet many aspects of game design lie largely unexamined still, as most systems focus on two-dimensional games with clear objectives and goal-oriented gameplay. This paper describes several attempts to build an automated game designer for 3D games more focused on space, atmosphere and experience. We describe our attempts to build these systems, why they failed, and what steps and future work we believe would be useful for future attempts by others."
