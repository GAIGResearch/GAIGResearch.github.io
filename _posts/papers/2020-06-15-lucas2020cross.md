abstract: "This demo paper describes a simple and practical approach to writing cross-platform casual games using the Kotlin programming language. A key aim is to make it much easier for researchers to demonstrate their AI playing a range of games. Pure Kotlin code (which excludes using any Java graphics libraries) can be transpiled to JavaScript and run in a web browser. However, writing Kotlin code that will run without modification both in a web browser and on the JVM is not trivial; it requires strict adherence to an appropriate methodology. The contribution of this paper is to provide such a method including a software design and to demonstrate this working for Tetris, played either by AI or human."
