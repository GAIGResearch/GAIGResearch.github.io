abstract: "Hyperparameter tuning is an important mixed-integer optimisation problem, especially in the context of real-world applications such as games. In this paper, we propose a function suite around hyperparameter optimisation of game AI based on the card game Splendor and using the Rinascimento framework. We propose several different functions and demonstrate their complexity and diversity. We further suggest various possible extensions of the proposed suite."
