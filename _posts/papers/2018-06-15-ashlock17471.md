abstract: "Automatically generating games, including rules, environments, and boards, is a difficult type of automatic content generation. There are many possible levels on which Automatic Game Design (AGD) can happen. One of the simpler types of AGD is to take an existing game with a large number of parameters and set those parameters so that the resulting game is fun or interesting. This group discussed the possibilities for making the problem of automatic game design easier by designing the search space, while assuming that only playable games are of interest."
