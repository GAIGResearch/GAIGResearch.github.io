abstract: "Stratega, a general strategy games framework, has been designed to foster research on computational intelligence for strategy games. In contrast to other strategy game frameworks, Stratega allows to create a wide variety of turn-based and real-time strategy games using a
common API for agent development. While the current version supports the development of turn-based strategy games and agents, we will add support for real-time strategy games in future updates. Flexibility is achieved by utilising YAML-files to configure tiles, units, actions, and levels. Therefore, the user can design and run a variety of games to test developed agents without specifically adjusting it to the game being generated. The framework has
been built with a focus of statistical forward planning (SFP) agents. For this purpose, agents can access and modify game-states and use the forward model to simulate the outcome of their actions. While SFP agents have shown great flexibility in general game-playing, their performance is limited in case of complex state and action-spaces. Finally, we hope that the development of this framework and its respective agents helps to better understand the complex decision-making process in strategy games.
