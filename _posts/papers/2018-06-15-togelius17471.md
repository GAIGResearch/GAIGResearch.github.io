abstract: "Matching tile games are a genre of casual game based on, as the name implies, grids of tiles that need to be matched in various ways to clear them and/or score points. Popular examples include Bejeweled, Tetris, and Candy Crush Saga. This working group was inspired by two attempts to formalize the variation of game mechanics in the construction of this genre of games: a paper that examines the history of how these games as arose historically through adaptations and variations on existing games, and a lengthy blog post cataloguing the various axes of variation needed to account for the games in this space."
