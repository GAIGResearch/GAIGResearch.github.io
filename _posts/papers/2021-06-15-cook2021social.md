title: "The Social Responsibility of Game AI"
journal: "arXiv:2105.15122"

abstract: "Over the last decade we have watched as artificial intelligence has been transformed into one of the most important issues of our time, and games have grown into the biggest entertainment industry. As a result, game AI research as a field has enjoyed increased access to funding, exposure in the press, and influence with governments and some of the largest technology firms in the world. At this pivotal moment in the history of our field, this paper argues that this privileged position brings with it an important set of responsibilities which we have largely failed to meet. We show to whom we are responsible, identify some of these responsibilities, and suggest actions we can take as a community to leverage this power for good."
