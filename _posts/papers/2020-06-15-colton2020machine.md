abstract: "The human condition can be characterised as the most essential characteristics, events and situations which describe human existence. We propose that a parallel discussion of the machine condition could improve public understanding of computational systems in general, and advance perception of creativity in computational creativity systems in particular. We present a framework for machines to creatively express their existence, sketch some aspects of the machine condition, and describe potential benefits of this approach."
