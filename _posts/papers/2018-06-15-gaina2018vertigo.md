abstract: This report presents a tool developed for the analysis and visualisation of Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms, featuring a GUI which allows integration within the General Video Game AI Framework. Users are able to easily customize the parameters of the agent between runs and observe an in-depth analysis of its performance through various visual information extracted from gameplay data, live while playing the game. This visualisation aims to inform a deeper analysis into algorithm behaviour, in an attempt to justify why they make the decisions they do and improve their performance based on this knowledge.
