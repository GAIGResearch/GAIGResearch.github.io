abstract: "For general video game playing agents, the biggest challenge is adapting to the wide variety of situations they encounter and responding appropriately. Some success was recently achieved by modifying search-control parameters in agents on-line, during one play-through of a game. We propose adapting such methods for Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms, which have shown high performance in many different environments, and test the effect of on-line adaptation on the agent’s win rate. On-line tuned agents are able to achieve results comparable to the state of the art, including ﬁrst win rates in hard problems, while employing a more general and highly adaptive approach. We additionally include further insight into the algorithm itself, given by statistics gathered during the tuning process and highlight key parameter choices."
