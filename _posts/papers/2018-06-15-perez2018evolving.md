title: "Evolving behaviour tree structures using grammatical evolution"
author: Perez-Liebana, Diego and Nicolau, Miguel
publisher: Springer
booktitle: Handbook of Grammatical Evolution
pages: 433--460
abstract: "Behaviour Trees are control structures with many applications in computer science, including robotics, control systems, and computer games. They allow the specification of controllers from very broad behaviour definitions (close to the root of the tree) down to very specific technical implementations (near the leaves); this allows them to be understood and extended by both behaviour designers and technical programmers. This chapter describes the process of applying Grammatical Evolution (GE) to evolve Behaviour Trees for a real-time video-game: the Mario AI Benchmark. The results obtained show that these structures are quite amenable to artificial evolution using GE, and can provide a good balance between longterm (pathfinding) and short-term (reactiveness to hazards and power-ups) planning within the same structure."
