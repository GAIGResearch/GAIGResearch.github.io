abstract: "In order to advance the field of procedural content generation, and transfer knowledge from academic research to everyday use, we need to develop tools that make generative systems easier to understand and control. In this paper we introduce Danesh, a plugin to the Unity game development environment. We describe Danesh's various features, including automatic analysis and visualisation tools, and provide reflections on both our development of the tool and our experiences of using it in educational contexts."
