Griddly provides a highly optimized game state and rendering engine with a flexible high-level interface for configuring environments. Not only does Griddly offer simple interfaces for single, multi-player and RTS games, but also multiple methods of rendering, configurable partial observability and interfaces for procedural content generation."
