abstract: "The notion of framing computationally created artefacts - by providing a narrative context for the actions and motivations of the software - is an important part of building computationally creative software. In this paper we provide the first survey of framing in computational creativity; we provide a taxonomy of framing elements, covering motivation, implementation and rendering; and we look at future directions for framing, as well as its importance for the fieldâ€™s future."
