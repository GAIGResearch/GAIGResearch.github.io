abstract: "While the quality of computationally generated artefacts continues to improve, some people still find it difficult to accept software as being creative. To help address this issue, we introduce the notion of creativity theatre, whereby computational creativity systems demonstrate their creative behaviours, not only for the purpose of producing valuable artefacts, but also to heighten the sense that observers have of it being creative. We present an approach to this whereby an entirely separate AI system controls a casual creator app, which is normally used as a creativity support tool by people. We describe the ‘Can You See What I Can See?’ installation which performs such creativity theatre, and describe its operation in a recent open house event."
