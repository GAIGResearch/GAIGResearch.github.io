abstract: "This paper introduces a computer-game design tool which enables game designers to explore and develop game mechanics for arbitrary game systems. The tool is implemented as a plugin for the Godot game engine. It allows the designer to view an abstraction of a game's states while in active development and to quickly view and explore which states are navigable from which other states. This information is used to rapidly explore, validate and improve the design of the game. The tool is most practical for game systems which are computer-explorable within roughly 2000 states. The tool is demonstrated by presenting how it was used to create a small, yet complete, commercial game."
