abstract: "Large action spaces is one of the most problematic aspects of turn-based strategy games for all types of AI methods. Some of the state-of-the-art algorithms such as Online Evolutionary Planning and Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) have tried to deal with this problem, but they required a fixed number of actions in each turn. In general strategy games, this assumption canâ€™t be held, as the number of actions that can be executed in a turn is flexible and will vary during the game. This paper studies pruning techniques and the insertion of domain knowledge to deal with high branching factors in a new turn-based strategy game: Tribes. The experiments show that, with the help of these techniques, MCTS can increase its performance and outperform the rule-based agents and Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms. Moreover, some insights into the tree shape and the behaviour of MCTS with and without pruning techniques are provided."
