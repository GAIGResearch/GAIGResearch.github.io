abstract: "The Games Fusion Project was an experimental learning experience that mirrored commercial realities and processes in order to wrap the core game-making skills in a fusion of wider industry-relevant competencies. This provided both contextual knowledge and exposed participants to failure and reflection, foregrounding the importance of iterative learning loops, foundational in creative digital industry design processes as well as  (experiential) learning paradigms. This project has explored how the relevance of game design for education lies not only in the creative, communication and project management competencies exposed in the game design process but also how this can be abstracted to inform project curriculum development more widely."
