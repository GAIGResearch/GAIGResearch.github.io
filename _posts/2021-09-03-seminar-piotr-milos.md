The Game AI Research Group is glad to announce a (virtual) talk by Piotr Miłoś on Wednesday September 15th at 13:00.

All welcome (especially students), no pre-booking required 

## Abstract

Planning and search have been immensely studied topics in AI research. However, still many questions stay unanswered. In my talk, I will explore topics on the intersection of planning and learning. A general question is how learning methods can be used to make planning more efficient. A closely related one is how to develop planning methods robust to (unavoidable) errors of learned models.

I will present Subgoal Search and Entropy Search Tree based on our recent work [1] [2].
