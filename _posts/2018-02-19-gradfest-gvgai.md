This tutorial is aimed to introduce the concept of general game Artificial Intelligence through the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework. The event will begin with a talk describing the higher-level concepts and give an idea about the research carried out in the field, then narrowing down to the specific challenge at hand.

Refreshments, lunch and networking opportunities will be provided as part of the event.

This event is organised by PhD student, [Raluca D. Gaina](/members/Raluca-Gaina) within the context of QMUL GradFest.
