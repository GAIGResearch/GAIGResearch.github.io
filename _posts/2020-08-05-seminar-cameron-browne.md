The Game AI Research Group is glad to announce a (virtual) talk by Cameron Browne on Wednesday 19th of August 2020 at 13:00.

All welcome (especially students), no pre-booking required 

## Abstract

Almost any physical game board can be described as a graph, whose vertices represent playable sites and edges represent adjacencies between these. However, the simplicity of this model belies a surprising complexity if the full range of possible game boards is to be supported. This talk will present our approach to modelling general game boards in the Ludii general game system (http://ludii.games) and discuss some of the geometric challenges encountered when implementing the current corpus of 250+ games. There will be some graph theory, some geometry, some game design, and lots of visual examples.

## Bio

Cameron Browne is an Associate Professor at Maastricht University's Department of Knowledge Engineering, where he is running the €2m ERC-funded Digital Ludeme Project. Cameron completed his PhD at the Queensland University of Technology in 2009, producing the world's first published computer-generated games. He is author of the books Hex Strategy, Connection Games and Evolutionary Game Design, which won the 2012 GECCO “Humies” award for human-competitive results in evolutionary computation. Cameron has 39 granted patents and is Section Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Games and the International Computer Games Association (ICGA) Journal.
