The Game AI Research Group is glad to announce a (virtual) talk by Antonios Liapis on November 23rd 2022 at 13:00. Members of DERI can also join the talk in person (PB.7, limited space)

## Abstract

Generating high-quality game content relies on understanding the interdependencies between the game's rules and its aesthetic qualities. Beyond level generation, games consist of a multitude of facets including the ruleset, visuals, audio, narrative, and even the players' creative interpretations of all the above.  This talk focuses on a class of algorithms from artificial evolution that target both the Quality and Diversity of the output, and highlights how such algorithms can be valuable for content generation. The talk highlights recent research at the Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta on QD-driven game content generation, and discusses how similar concepts can be repurposed for tasks such as controlling game agents.

## Biography

Antonios Liapis is a Senior Lecturer at the Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta, where he bridges the gap between game technology and game design in courses focusing on human-computer creativity, digital prototyping and game development. He received his Ph.D. degree in Information Technology from the IT University of Copenhagen in 2014. His research focuses on Artificial Intelligence as an autonomous creator or as a facilitator of human creativity. His work includes computationally intelligent tools for game design, user models for the design process, gameplay, or visual preference, as well as evolutionary computation and deep learning. He has published over 120 research papers on these topics, and has received several awards for his research contributions and reviewing effort. He serves in the IEEE Technical Committee on Games and as associate editor of the IEEE Transactions on Games.
