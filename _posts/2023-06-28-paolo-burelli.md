The Game AI Research Group is glad to announce a (virtual) talk by Paolo Burelli on Wednesday July 5th at 13:00.

## Abstract

Videogames have been a catalyst for advances in many research fields, such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction or virtual reality. For instance, over the years, artificial intelligence has enabled new types of games, while games have served as one of the primary test beds for artificial intelligence. Can this happen also with neuroscience? In this talk, we’ll try to answer this question, analysing the current state-of-the-art at the crossroads between neuroscience and games and envision future directions.

## Biography

Paolo Burelli is an Associate Professor at the IT University of Copenhagen and the head of the brAIn lab at the Centre for Digital Play. Dr Burelli’s research has always hinged around the problem of how machines can understand humans and around this topic, he has researched different methods to build user models that predict and explain how players behave, think and feel. In this area, Dr. Burelli has published more than 30 articles in international conferences and journals, and made contributions to books.
