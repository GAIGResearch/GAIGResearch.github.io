The Game AI Research Group is glad to announce a (virtual) talk by Alena Denisova on Wednesday October 5th, 2022, at 13:00. Members of DERI can also join the talk in person (PB.7), although there is limited space available.

All welcome (especially students), no pre-booking required 

## Abstract

Challenge is arguably an important experience that many players seek in video games. To be able to deliver well-balanced player experiences for players with varied skills and preferences, it is important to be able to understand how this experience of challenge manifests itself in different games and for different players, what aspects of video games and personal characteristics of players affect this experience, and how one can assess it. In this talk, I will give an overview of some of the recent work done to define and measure perceived challenge, reflect on how one can design for the ‘right level’ of challenge, the implications of this work, and potential further research directions in this area.

## Bio

Dr Alena Denisova is a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of York, UK. Her interdisciplinary research focuses on conceptualising, measuring and improving user experiences of video game players and designing, developing tools and methods for researching interactive experiences, and building educational and persuasive interactive media. In particular, her work explores the role of the `placebo effect’ of technology in shaping player experiences, perceived challenge and uncertainty in video games, and, more recently, emotionally impactful player experiences - understanding how these experiences are shaped with the view to inform the design of games that promote these experiences.
