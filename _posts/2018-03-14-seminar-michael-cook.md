## Abstract

It’s a golden age for AI in games – they can play them, they can generate content for them, they can even design them. But what does this really mean for games culture? Is AI doomed to live in a dark room and only come out when we ask it to play Go?
In this talk, computational creativity researcher Michael Cook talks about the history of the future of automated game design; his latest work on his game designing AI ANGELINA; and explains how the future of AI isn’t a captive algorithm in a box, but an independent digital creative, with its own agenda, its own dreams, and its own Twitch channel.
