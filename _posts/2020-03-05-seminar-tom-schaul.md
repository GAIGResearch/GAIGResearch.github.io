## Bio

Tom Schaul has been a researcher at DeepMind for 6 years. His research is focused on reinforcement learning with deep neural networks, but includes modular and continual learning, black-box optimization, temporal and state abstractions, off-policy learning about many goals simultaneously, and video-game benchmarks. Tom grew up in Luxembourg and studied computer science in Switzerland (with exchanges at Waterloo and Columbia), where he obtained an MSc from the EPFL in 2005. He holds a PhD from TU Munich (2011), which he did under the supervision of JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA. From 2011 to 2013, he did a postdoc with Yann LeCun at the Courant Institute of NYU.
