The Game AI Research Group is glad to announce a (virtual) talk by Georgios Yannakakis on Wednesday June 23 at 13:00.

All welcome (especially students), no pre-booking required 

## Abstract

Games have been a core driving force for the revolution of AI which, in turn, has reframed our culture, and reshaped our society at large. While games have been assisting AI since its birth, it is only very recently that we experience a strong inverse relationship: AI nowadays designs exciting games for us to play and experience, and for AI to advance further. While games are arguably one of the last frontiers for AI, AI is also the next great leap forward for games. The talk will take us through a number of AI and Games projects currently running at the Institute of Digital Games, University of Malta, and modl.ai.

Between 2007 and 2012, he was an Associate Professor at the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen. He does research at the crossroads of artificial intelligence, computational creativity, affective computing, advanced game technology, and human-computer interaction. He pursues research concepts such as user experience modelling and procedural content generation for the design of personalized interactive systems for entertainment, education, training and health. He has published over 260 journal and conference papers. His research has been supported by numerous national and European grants (including a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship) and has appeared in Science Magazine and New Scientist, among other venues. He has been involved in a number of journal editorial boards, is currently an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Games and the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation and was an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing between 2009 and 2017. He has been the General Chair of key conferences in the area of game artificial intelligence (IEEE CIG 2010) and games research (FDG 2013, FDG 2020). He is the co-author of the Artificial Intelligence and Games textbook and the co-organiser of the Artificial Intelligence and Games summer school series.
