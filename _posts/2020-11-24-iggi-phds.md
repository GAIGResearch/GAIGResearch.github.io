## Why IGGI?

IGGI is a collaboration between the University of York and Queen Mary, University of London. The programme trains PhD researchers to become the next generation of leaders in games research, design, and development and create positive social and economic impact through games.

You will receive focused skills training in game design, games research methods, game development, game AI, responsible innovation, and engaging users and the public with your work. In addition, you will have access to optional training in a wide range of topics such as HCI, graphics, audio, psychology, or AI.

You will also have opportunities to collaborate with other students and researchers, make games, and share your work through

* the annual IGGI Game Jam, a 48 hour game development challenge as part of the Global Game Jam, enhancing your skills in game design, development, and teamwork;
* the annual IGGI Conference, showcasing student research alongside industry and academic speakers;
* student-led events such as research seminars, board game evenings, or workshops.

IGGI will give you the opportunity to work directly with industry and social partner organisations. Placements, research exchanges, and other forms of knowledge exchange will give you the possibility to make a direct positive impact, experience the games industry first hand, and collaborate with researchers and practitioners. Current IGGI students have worked with partner organisations such as Sony Interactive Entertainment, Bossa Studios, Google, Bloomberg, Media Molecule, BT, Splash Damage, Microsoft Research, and Sue Ryder. You can find a list of more IGGI partners at [www.iggi.org.uk/industry-partners/](www.iggi.org.uk/industry-partners/)

IGGI students are a diverse group, and admission is decided on the basis of your potential to do excellent research and contribute to IGGIâ€™s goal of making a positive impact with games research. We especially welcome applications from female and minority ethnic candidates as well as other groups that are under-represented in games research and industry.

We welcome all international students from inside and outside the EU to apply: the main funding body UKRI has announced that international students will be eligible for a full stipend and tuition.
