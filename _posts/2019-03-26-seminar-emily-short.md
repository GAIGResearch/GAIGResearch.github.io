On Wednesday 27th March 2019 the Game AI Group will host a seminar by Emily Short from Spirit AI. All welcome (especially students), no pre-booking required.

## Abstract

This talk introduces Character Engine, a system for writing natural language or menu-based interactions with non-player characters, designed for a range of use cases from mobile gaming to voice-driven conversations with robots. We discuss the architecture of the system, the use of ML systems for understanding player intent, social models used to assist in contextual understanding of player input, and the application of more traditional game AI methods such as utility scoring and generative grammars to determine character responses. We also look at design features intended to support authors who might not themselves be experts in AI or NLP.
