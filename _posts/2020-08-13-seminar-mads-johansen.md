All welcome (especially students), no pre-booking required 

## Abstract

Video game prototyping and game jamming is often used to create and verify game artifacts. However, while experienced game designers can visualize the end result from purely mechanical prototypes; players, investors and inexperienced developers might need a little more convincing. That means in order to validate prototypes with play testers, acquire funding from investors or convince the rest of your team a prototype is worth developing, game prototypes need Juice (excessive feedback in the form of Visual and Sound Effects). Squeezer is a Juice prototyping tool for Unity, created to assist game designers create Juicy placeholder effects for their game prototypes. Mads set out to create a simple “Synthesizer” for Juice effects, that can be used to Procedurally Generate effect sequences, and execute them when certain events happen in games.
