The Game AI Research Group is glad to announce a (virtual) talk by Matthew De Abaitua on Wednesday November 24th 2021 at 13:00.

All welcome (especially students), no pre-booking required 

## Abstract

The philosopher Alva Noe suggests that art is a strange tool that alters our relationship with the tools and technologies that are embedded in our lives. In this brief talk, I will consider Artificial intelligence as a strange tool, thereby placing it in relationship to the art form of the novel. This opens up a consideration of whether the novel as a form is a proto-AI: the two strange tools share similarities in terms of the role of probability, evidence or data, and the modelling of human behaviour in the form of character.
