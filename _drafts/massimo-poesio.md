I am a full professor of Computational Linguistics at the  School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London. My research interests are in the semantics of natural language and in computational methods for semantic analysis, particularly in the areas of anaphora resolution and in dialogue. One of my main areas of research at the moment is the use of games to collect data to support computational linguistics (‘Games with a purpose’) – two examples are [Phrase Detectives](http://www.phrasedetectives.org) and [TileAttack](http://tileattack.com/)!
