Cris is a Spaniard in love with London, where she’s been living since 2013. She studied a BE in Computer Engineering at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (Spain) and worked as web developer for a couple of years before taking the decision of changing to the exciting world of AI and games. Her research interests include General Video Game Playing (GVGP), Procedural Content Generation (PCG) and automatic evaluation. She tries to keep active outside the sedentary PhD live, mostly walking around the city, cycling and attempting different sports. Random facts are her fascination with swords and that her chosen superpower would be teleportation.
