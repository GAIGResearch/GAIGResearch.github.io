I am a reader in the [School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Queen Mary and Westfield College](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/), [University of London](http://www.lon.ac.uk/). I was awarded the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [National University of Singapore](http://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2002, under the supervision of [Dr. Cheong Loong-Fah](http://www.ee.nus.edu.sg/ee/view1.asp?user=eleclf) and [Dr. Ong Sim-Heng](http://www.ee.nus.edu.sg/ee/view1.asp?user=eleongsh). My Ph.D. research is on 3-D Computer Vision and Visual Perception. I also received the B. Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from [Xiâ€™an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 1995, and the M. Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from [Communication University of China](http://www.cuc.edu.cn/) in 1998. In 2001, I joined the [Dept. of Computer Science](http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/), Queen Mary and Westfield College, University of London as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant. As a member of the [Vision Group](http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/vision/) and Game AI research group, I first worked on the [DTI](http://www.dti.gov.uk/) and [EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/website/index/aspx) funded project [ICONS](http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/vision/projects/ICONS/) (Incident Recognition for Surveillance and Security) and then the EPSRC and [MOD](http://www.mod.uk/) [DSTL](http://www.dstl.gov.uk/) jointly funded project [INSIGHT](http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/research/vision/projects/INSIGHT/) (Video Analysis and Selective Zooming using Semantic Models of Human Presence and Absence).
